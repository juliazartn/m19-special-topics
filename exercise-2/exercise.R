  # 1. Create training and testing datasets by sampling 75% of your data from your `homes` dataframe.
    train.indices <- sample(seq_len(nrow(homes)), size = sample.size)
    train.data <- homes[train.indices,]
    test.data <- homes[-train.indices,]
    
  # 2. Pass your **training data** to the `rpart` function to run a simple classification operation
  basic.fit <- rpart(in_sf ~ ., data = train.data, method = "class")
  
  # 3. Pass your results to the `AssessFit` function to assess the fit
  train.assessment <- AssessFit(basic.fit, data = test.data)
  
  # 4. Store your assessment in the `basic.fits` vector
   basic.fits <- c(basic.fits, train.assessment)
}

# 5. Make a histogram of your `basic.fits` vector
hist(basic.fits)

# 6. Take the mean of your `basic.fits` vector
mean(basic.fits)

# 7. Pass your most recent model to the `rpart.plot` function to graph it
rpart.plot(basic.fit)
